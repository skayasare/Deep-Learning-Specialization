# Deep-Learning-Specialization
This repository contains notebook files for assignments, and notes in the Deep Learning Specialization Course by Coursera, taught by Andrew Ng. 
This Specialization covers building neural network
architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent
Neural Networks, LSTMs, Transformers, and learning how to make
them better with strategies such as Dropout, BatchNorm, and
Xavier/He initialization. It also presents great theoretical concepts,
their industry applications using Python and TensorFlow, and
tackled real-world cases such as speech recognition, music synthesis,
chatbots, machine translation, natural language processing, and more.
